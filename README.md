# SSG_MovieApp

In the project directory, you can run:

###  `npm install` 

This will download all dependencies in the package.json file and generate a 
node_modules folder.

Before starting the app in your local environment, navigate to 
key.js file (./src/key.js) and insert your own or a provided API key and 
access token in its corresponding variables. 
A default List ID is provided, but can be replaced with an available LIST ID.

Ex. (key.js file)

<br/>
export const API_KEY = "INSERT_API_KEY" --> export const API_KEY = "XXXXXXXX"
<br/>
export const ACCESS_TOKEN = "INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN" --> export const ACCESS_TOKEN = "XXXXXXXX"
<br/>
export const LIST_ID = "7058012" --> export const LIST_ID = "XXXXXXXX"


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
